# Lesson 2: _Refresh my memory_

Memory is a storage space that holds data for a finite time. Itâ€™s used by desktop applications, games, apps, etc., to store specific data. Many devices and hardware peripherals today have some form of memory installed, with storage limited to a particular amount. PCs, laptops, consoles, tablets, smartphones, graphics cards, you name it, hold _Random Access Memory_, or RAM. In C++, memory is allocated and managed by using _variables_.
