# Lesson 2: _Refresh my memory_

Memory is a storage space that holds data for a finite time. It’s used by desktop applications, games, apps, etc., to store specific data. Many devices and hardware peripherals today have some form of memory installed, with storage limited to a particular amount. PCs, laptops, consoles, tablets, smartphones, graphics cards, you name it, hold _Random Access Memory_, or RAM. In C++, memory is allocated and managed by using _variables_.

## "I now declare you to be a variable"

Variables are temporary storage spaces in memory that contain data for the program and are identified by an address. Data is stored as binary bits and bytes and represented differently based on the variable type. 
To create a variable, we must declare it first, which tells the compiler that you wish to use the following named memory block to store your data. The compiler will set some memory aside for you so that you can use that variable to store your data. Each variable has a type, which tells the compiler how much memory to set aside. Therefore, it’s imperative that when declaring variables, we specify their type and a suitable name.

```cpp
char letter;
int number;
float decimal;
```

Variable names in C++ are case-sensitive and should always start with a letter. They may contain numbers and underscores after that. You should always follow a standard when naming your variables. If you have not set your own, follow common _coding standards_ set by either your employer if you're working on a team or your lecturer if you're studying at university. A general standard for naming variables is to use _Camel Casing_, i.e., `thisIsAVariable`.

Declaring multiple variables of the same type can be done in one line, like so:

```cpp
int number1, number2, number3;
```
