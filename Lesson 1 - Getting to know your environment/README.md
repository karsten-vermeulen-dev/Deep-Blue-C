# Lesson 1: Getting to know your environment

You are probably eager to start coding, but let's spend some time learning about C++. We will begin by looking at what C++ is, why we should care about it, and who on earth uses it. 

## What exactly is C++?
C++ is the universal language in game programming and is widely used for general application development. It was created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 and released in 1983. The International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, has since standardised it, with the current standard being C++23 and C++26 on the way. Created as a successor to C, C++ is still one of the most widely used programming languages ever. It is an object-oriented programming language, sometimes called C with classes that is largely backwards compatible with C.

## Why are we using it?
Well, for one thing, it is superfast, allowing developers to squeeze out the best performance in a game or application. It is also extremely well supported, with many different third-party libraries and code assets available. C++ is a multi-paradigm, intermediate-level programming language that offers extreme flexibility when developing applications. Finally, it allows more control over peripherals, giving programmers direct access to hardware and memory.

## Who else uses C++?
Many game engines are either written in C++ or have some form of C++ under the hood. If you are not into developing games, you might want to use this powerful programming language to create regular desktop or mobile applications or audio plugins. Many third-party graphics, audio, and physics libraries and APIs have been written in C or C++, allowing developers to seamlessly link their code and build their applications. C++ is one of the main programming languages used to create AAA game titles and has helped develop languages such as Java and C#. It is a very complex language that has evolved over the last few decades and seen many additions to its extensive library.

## Some popular game engines worth mentioning 

| Engine          | Description    |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Unity           | A popular game engine built using C++ yet offering only C# scripting to the developer           |
| Unreal Engine   | Epic's grand master of engines, written in C++ with the option to code in C++ as an alternative to using _Blueprints_     |
| CryEngine       | German studio Crytek's famous engine, popular for the game _Far Cry_, is also written in C++     |
| Open 3D Engine  | Based on Amazon's _Lumberyard_ engine, which in turn is based on _CryEngine_, this new kid on the block also uses C++ alongside Lua and Python     |
| Source 2        | Developed by Valve, this C++ engine can be credited for creating _Dota 2_ and _Half-Life: Alyx_    |
| Frostbite       | Known for producing the Battlefield series of games, Electronic Arts' baby is written in both C++ and C#                                               |
| Godot           | Initially created by two Argentine developers, it was released to the public in 2014. The popular adventure game _Deponia_ was made using this engine  | 
  	
## Tell me about this so-called games industry
The gaming market is massive, globally worth over $100bn annually, with the UK games industry worth about £5bn. The UK has the 6th largest market in the world, following Germany, South Korea, Japan, USA, and China. You can choose to work for any studio, be that AAA, mid-level or indie, and within that realm, you can choose to develop many different kinds of games, namely desktop, console, mobile, online, AR, and VR. And within that, career paths are abundant, namely tools, physics, graphics, gameplay, audio, and AI.

## Want to develop software instead?
Why not? It is a lucrative career and makes good money, too. But that shouldn’t be your ultimate reason for entering the industry. Your passion for creating new cutting-edge software should drive you to pursue this career. In this field, you get the chance to develop applications rather than games, and as such, the software you create might not appear as exciting or dynamic as a game. You could develop applications such as audio plugins, database managers, banking apps, and medical and audio visualisers, to name a few. Much of the middleware that you use in the industry will most likely be written in C++.
	
## Some popular software APIs worth mentioning

| API           | Description    |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| JUCE          | Short for _Jules' Utility Class Extensions_, this cross-platform C++ application framework allows developers to use C++ to create audio apps and plugins with a rich UI   |
| OpenGL        | An ancient yet popular graphics API written in C that allows developers to harness the raw power of the GPU to create visual applications   |
| wxWidgests    | Another C++ library that offers developers a widget toolkit to create GUI applications   |
| wWise         | Another excellent tool for creating audio applications or to integrate audio into your existing application (or game)   |
| OpenVR        | Developed by Valve and created using C, C++, and C#, this API allows developers to manipulate virtual reality devices in their applications   |
| Qt            | Pronounced que tee or simply cute, this software development behemoth gives developers the power to create just about any (GUI) application that can run on just about any device   |
